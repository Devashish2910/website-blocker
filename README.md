# Website Blocker with Python  🕸
A small practice project with Python, to block unwanted websites during a day for the specific time frame.  
  
### How to test it!!   (I'm assuming you've Python installed)
 - Clone the repo from [here](https://github.com/Devashish2910/website-blocker)
 - Extract it
 - Go to project folder, open file `wb.py`
 - Insert the website url in `block_list`(As already shown) at line `7`
 - Change the timing if you want to at line `11` (Default is `8 am to 11 pm`
 - Save it
 - ***Mac*** users follow below steps...
 

> - Open the `Terminal` and navigate to the project folder root 
>  - Now...   if python3: `sudo python3 wb.py` 	  else: `sudo python wb.py`


 
## Future Task: 🤘🏽🤔

 1. Scheduling of the program to work on the background 
 2. Program it for windows user (Coming Soon!)
